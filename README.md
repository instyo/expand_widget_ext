This Dart package offers developers a streamlined library of Flutter widgets, useful for expanding widgets and text views, when users interact with them.

There are two main 'expand' widgets:

- **Expand Child:** Useful to show more widgets related to the content already visible by the user.
- **Expand Text:** Useful when texts can be quite big for a certain screen. It adds the ability to show the full content when the user wants to.

- You can also provide your own widget for the expand indicator, using the `indicatorBuilder` for both expaning widgets.

- Use custom expanding hint strings! By default, it will use the ones provided by `MaterialLocalizations`.

- Expand text view with swipe-down gestures, using the `expandOnGesture`, which by default is set to `false`.

- You can also customize expand animation duration and curve easilly.
